# TNBC_Spatial_LDA
In the field of cancer research, the analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for predicting tumor behavior and patient outcomes. Advanced imaging techniques such as Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI TOF) are essential for acquiring detailed spatial information about the TME. However, traditional methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) often yield topics that are not significantly different from one another, limiting their usefulness in spatially complex datasets. To address this limitation, our research introduces a novel approach utilizing spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (spatial LDA). This method involves creating "documents" from each image sample along with its spatial coordinates, assuming that each document is a mixture of topics, with topics assigned based on the spatial proximity of the documents. By comparing spatial LDA with traditional LDA, we demonstrate its enhanced capability to capture and reflect the spatial variations within the TME, thereby providing a more effective tool for understanding tumor dynamics.
